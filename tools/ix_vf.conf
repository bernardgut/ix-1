# cluster_config.sh config file.
# this allows you to run IX on a set of machines out of the box. This script
# aims to deploy the optimal configuration accross a set of machines in order to
# run IX the same way as the published benchmarks.
#
# collumns :
# - $HOST : URI of machine.
# - $CONFIG=['server','client'] : add server specific checks/configuration.
# - $STACK=['ix','ix-vf''linux','linux-vf'] : the stack configuration. in case
#            of 'ix' it is recommended to provide the dune and pcidma kernel
#            modules path through the script options so they can be loaded into
#            the target kernel by cluster_config.sh.
# - $IFACE : a valid interface name on which to apply this config
# - $IFACE_DRIVER : default driver name used with interface $IFACE
# - $VF_IP : (optional) IPs to assign to virtual interfaces. only valid for
#            $STACK='linux-vf'.

# $HOST $CONFIG $STACK $IFACE $IFACE_DRIVER [$VF-IP]
